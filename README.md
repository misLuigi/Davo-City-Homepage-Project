# Davo-City-Homepage-Project
This is a HTML and CSS project for module 2 on Scrimba.

In this project I expound my knowledge regarding styling with css, classes and ids in HTML.

While this simple project is a static website and not interactive, this is most of what I learned from the lessons.

Whith this, I learned how:

- Align elements using flexbox.
- Make use of classes and ids on my HTML elements inorder for me to call them on CSS.
- Making the images round by giving them maximum border-radius of 50%.
- Margins and paddings.
- Background Images.
- Learn how to design in Figma and implement it on my coded website.
- MOST OF ALL, I learned how to seek help from the community and google things as a way to fix problems I encoutered while making this project.

Thank you for reading this README file and I hope you my solo project good. ðŸ˜Š
